# m4sprototype Mint 4 Students
Much of the concept for this redesign is displayed on the website. The website itself is quite simple... and ugly, maybe i'll update it one day. The beginning animation is pretty cool, so just keep hitting refresh for a cool leaf (hand drawn in AI) animation. 

# About
